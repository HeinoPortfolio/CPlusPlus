# Simple CPP Class
<p>  This is a simple class that will model some information about an employee.  It will contain the employee's ID, the number of hours worked, the hourly rate,  and the amount of pay they will receive.  It will use file I/O to read information from a text file that has this information one employee per line.  This is a modified problem #9 (Cannon, 199).
